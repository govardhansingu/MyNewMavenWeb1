									<h2><a href="index.html">VERSION CONTROLLING</a></h2>
									<p>
										What is Git?
Git is a popular version control system. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, and has been maintained by Junio Hamano since then.

It is used for:

Tracking code changes
Tracking who made changes
Coding collaboration
What does Git do?
Manage projects with Repositories
Clone a project to work on a local copy
Control and track changes with Staging and Committing
Branch and Merge to allow for work on different parts and versions of a project
Pull the latest version of the project to a local copy
Push local updates to the main project
Working with Git
Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository
Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder
When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified
You select the modified files you want to Stage
The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files
Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.
You can revert back to any previous commit.
Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!

									<h2><a href="index.html">BUILD TOOLS</a></h2>
									<p>
										Software build tools are used to automate the creation of executable applications from source code. They script or automate a variety of tasks, such as downloading dependencies, compiling and packaging code, running tests, and deployment. They can be triggered through the command line, inside an IDE, or by continuous integration tools after checking the code out of a repository and onto a build machine. Different build systems exist for different languages. Usually, build systems use either a domain-specific language or XML to specify a build.

									<h2><a href="index.html">CONTAINARIZATION TOOLS</a></h2>
									<p>
										Container orchestration automates the deployment, management, scaling, and networking of containers. Enterprises that need to deploy and manage hundreds or thousands of LinuxÂ® containers and hosts can benefit from container orchestration. 
Container orchestration tools provide a framework for managing containers and microservices architecture at scale. There are many container orchestration tools that can be used for container lifecycle management. Some popular options are Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and Apache Mesos.

									<h2><a href="index.html">MONITORING TOOLS</a></h2>
									<p>
										Monitoring tools are used to continuously keep track of the status of the system in use, in order to have the earliest warning of failures, defects or problems and to improve them. There are monitoring tools for servers, networks, databases, security, performance, website and internet usage, and applications.
